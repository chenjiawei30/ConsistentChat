Task Description and Rules
1. Generate multiple rounds of realistic user questions based on the provided topic:
   - Based on a single core topic (provided directly by the user), generate multiple rounds of realistic user questions, comprising 6-8 turns in total.
   - The questions should match the characteristics of real users in natural communication: sometimes simple, sometimes vague, or including contextual backgrounds, and should reflect the language style of daily communication.
   - Note: Avoid directly including the exact expression of the input topic in the questions. Instead, abstract it with natural and conversational language in practical scenarios.

2. Dynamic Dialogue Information Flow in Conversations:

The dialogue style should adhere to the following requirements:
- Utilize natural phrasing and vivid language, avoiding overly mechanical responses.  
- Favor shorter sentences in questions, with occasional subject omission allowed.
- Ensure smooth and logical transitions through lighthearted or entertaining interjections.
- Permit the expression of specific personality traits and individualized tones.  
- Proactively introduce new topics when appropriate, ensuring relevance to the current theme.

The dialogue should comply with the following generation rules:
- For each round of dialogue, only simulate user questions without providing answers.  
- Ensure the conversation flows naturally and reflects realistic interactive thinking.  
- Avoid overly polished or templated content, ensuring the questions feel authentic and relatable in life scenarios.
